# Android Programming Exercises
You will complete all homework and exercises in this git repository. 

## programming exercises
Each exercise will be in a seperate project/folder named ```ExerciseM_N``` where M and N correspond to the major and minor number of the exercise. For example the first codelab is called "Android fundamentals 0.1: Android Studio and Hello World", so the project and project directory is called ```Exercise1_1```, likewise the second homework/exercise is called ```Exercise_2```. 

## exercise questions
Most of the exercises have some associated questions. You will put your answers to questions to all to the exersises in the file ```Homework_Answers.md```. 

This file is written in **Markdown**, this is a very simplified version of html, it's goal is to be readable in text form, and to look good when rendered. You can learn more about [markdown here] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
